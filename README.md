I know I should use html or markdown throughout the entire thing but I need the centering of hmtl but don't need it for everything. So I just use markdown for the rest. 
Lazy I know, but it works

## About Me
![icons](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=py,java,arch,debian,raspberrypi,arduino,neovim,vscodium,git,fediverse "Some things I do or use")  
Just your average programmer who works on projects from time to time. I am a FIRST Alumni of FRC Team 5098 and have been apart of FIRST for around 6-7 years now at this point. Currently studying Computer Science and Computer Engineering at Missouri University of Science & Technology. I primarily use Java and Python for any projects. However, it is most often Python or Circuit Python (despite what my account says).
The 2 main projects I am working on is the Student Unmanned Aerial Systems Competition (SUAS) with the Multirotor team here at Missouri S&T and the First Robotics Competition (FRC) that I was in!
