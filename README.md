I know I should use html or markdown throughout the entire thing but I need the centering of hmtl but don't need it for everything. So I just use markdown for the rest. 
Lazy I know, but it works

## About Me
[![icons](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=py,java,linux,raspberrypi,arduino,discord,blender,vscode,github)](https://skillicons.dev)  
Programming captain and electrical co-captain for FRC team 5098, Sting-r! I mainly work on small projects from time to time on here. Mainly for FRC although I have some ones that I work on from time to time. Planning on working on a project whenever I get my hands on another Raspberry Pi 4 / Compute Module 4. Have some test code for it but can't test it yet. Will be getting more active as the years progress with a few projects underway, especially FRC related ones

## Announcments / Extra Info
Working on a project for the National Science Foundation. The goal is to help provide some automation for repetitive tasks for studying microbiology to help speed up research while also being relatively cheap so just about anyone can use it. Might update later on as the project progresses
