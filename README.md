Programming captain and electrical co-captain for FRC team 5098, Sting-r! I mainly work on small projects from time to time on here. Mainly for FRC although I have some ones that I work on from time to time. Planning on working on a project whenever I get my hands on another Raspberry Pi 4 / Compute Module 4. Have some test code for it but can't test it yet. Not super active on here right now. But every so often I will update something
